# Homework 05 - Work Day Scheduler

## Description

For this assignment, I was tasked with finishing a website to act as a work day calendar. I was given the base HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and needed to flesh out each part so that it would come together as a usuable site to plan a workday schedule.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The user will be presented with a webpage asking the players to start the game by clicking the "Start Quiz" button. Once started, the timer in the upper right-hand corner will begin to countdown as the player is asked a series of multiple choice questions. Correct answers will be logged and incorrect answers will deduct time from the remaining countdown. The final score will equate to the remaining time on the clock.

After the game, the player will be asked to enter their initals to join the scoreboard, which can be viewed by cliking the link in the upper left-hand corner. 


## Credits

First, a HUGE thank you goes out to my fellow students for sharing their code and rescources with me.I was stuck so many times and more often than not, they had the answer.

 Sitepoint.com and W3 provided much of the syntax and flow along with YouTuber Web Dev Simplified for showing me the basics along with pointing me in the wrong direction a few times.
